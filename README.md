This is a reboot of the Betri Menntun project started by Andri Ólafsson and Viktor Smári Ágústuson

## Summary

A tool to help teachers change the culture of teaching. By uploading lectures in small compartmentalized videos. By adding multiple versions of the same tests and assignments so students can retake them over and over again until they master the subject.

All the while teachers spend their time with the students doing something productive and engaging.
